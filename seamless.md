title: Seamless trial design
---

# Background

Seamless design concept was originally from the idea of combining the dose ranging study and the confirmative study together. In oncology drug development, however, dose ranging study is rarely conducted yet. The framework is corresponding to a multi-stage design that combines the exploratory stage and the confirmative stage. A large volume of research articles appeared in this design framework, however it is still not commonly seen in real practice of oncology clinical trials.

# Vision

Optimize oncology drug development by utilizing smart and efficient seamless drug development program

# Mission

- Identify the opportunities that are practically feasible and more efficient when utilizing seamless drug development program, and promote its use in industry
- Identify the gaps that need statistical innovations in utilizing seamless drug development program and provide pragmatic solutions.

# Objectives for 2022

- Complete the industry survey to understand the use of the seamless development program in oncology. Write a manuscript for the findings of the survey. 
- Perform a meta-analysis based on public literature database to create a list of practical clinical studies that used the seamless development program. Prepare a manuscript for the findings.
- Watch for the opportunities to propose a session in statistical conferences
