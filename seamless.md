title: Seamless trial design
---

# Background

Seamless design concept originated from the idea of combining the dose ranging study and the confirmative study together. In oncology drug development, however, dose ranging study is rarely conducted yet. The seamless framework is corresponding to a multi-stage design that combines the exploratory stage and the confirmative stage. 
In addition, accelerated (conditional) approval pathway provides another opportunity for oncology agents based on early phase studies. Seamless development program may be an efficient approach to bring drugs to patients early. A large volume of statistical methodology articles appeared in this design framework in the past two decades, however it is still not commonly seen in real practice of oncology clinical trials.

# Vision

Optimize oncology drug development by utilizing efficient seamless drug development program

# Mission

- Identify the current practices, challenges, and gaps in implementing pivotal seamless designs in oncology drug development.
- Develop pragmatic statistical and operational solutions to the gaps and challenges that prevent the use of seamless designs in settings where they are smart and efficient choices. 
- Communicate and engage with statistical and non-statistical audiences on the challenges and opportunities of seamless designs.

# Leaders

The taskforce is led by Philip He

# Objectives for 2022

- Complete the industry survey to understand the use of the seamless development program in oncology. Write a manuscript for the findings of the survey. 
- Perform a meta-analysis based on public literature database to create a list of practical clinical studies that used the seamless development program. Prepare a manuscript for the findings.
- Watch for the opportunities to propose a session in statistical conferences
