title: Master protocols
---

# Background

- Master Protocol types
  - Basket trial
  - Umbrella trial
  - Platform (complex) trial

- FDA issued oncology master protocol guidance
- EU/UK published white paper on platform trials and complex designs
- Different types of master protocol designs, more prominently basket and platform trials, have been implemented in cancer research, started more in exploratory phase and now including confirmatory phase
- In order to achieve efficiency gain, frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches have been developed
- Operational considerations in master protocol implementation seems to be one of the biggest challenges, along with knowledge gap and regulatory interaction complexity


# Mission

- Understand the current regulatory landscape in oncology master protocol designs
- Assess different master protocol trial designs in different settings (e.g. exploratory vs. confirmatory) to guide implementation and statistical methods
- Educate and outreach to other functions to resolve knowledge gaps, also develop practice guidance of master protocols
